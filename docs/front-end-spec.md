# UI/UX Specification

## Layout Architecture
* **Three-Column Responsive Grid**:
    * **Sidebar Navigation**: 280px fixed width (collapsible on mobile)
    * **Content List Panel**: 320px fixed width (stacks below sidebar on mobile)
    * **Main Content Area**: Flexible remaining space

## Component Structure
* **Sidebar Navigation**: Logo/App title, primary navigation, search, settings, and user profile.
* **Content List Panel**: Header with view title, filter/sort controls, and entry cards.
* **Main Content Area**: Rich text editor, image upload area, entry metadata, version history, and export functionality.

## Visual Design System
* **Color Scheme**: Primary whites and light grays, with a soft blue accent (#4A90E2).
* **Typography Scale**: A modern scale with clear hierarchy for headings and body text.
* **Component Styling**: 8px border radius for cards, subtle shadows, and spacing based on an 8px grid system.

## Key Interactive Patterns
* Sidebar toggle/collapse, rich text editor with toolbar, drag-and-drop image uploads, and a theme switcher.
